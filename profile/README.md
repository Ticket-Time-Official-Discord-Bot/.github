Credit for this README where credit's due:
- https://github.com/othneildrew/Best-README-Template/blob/main/README.md
- https://github.com/Louis3797/awesome-readme-template

These two templates have been extremely helpful when creating my own README template
and I've drawn inspiration from them heavily.

Please keep this acknowledgement in further modifications of the README file, though
it's not like I can tell you what to do. I'm just a comment in a text file.
